## PyBer Analysis Overview
This analysis aims to provide a cursory overview of average fares paid by PyBer customers in regards to both type of city (Rural, Suburba, or Urban) and time of year.
## Results
### Overall Summary
The overview of operations by city type are presented in the following table:
![Summary](/Analysis/summary.png)
As expected, the total number of rides, the total number of drivers, and the total profit of PyBer operations increases as city density increases (Rural -> Suburban -> Urban), with urban cities generating roughly 9.3 times as much revenue than rural areas, and 2.1 times as much revenue as suburban areas.
However, it turns out that urban environments are the least cost effective operations per capita, generating only $24.50 per ride, as opposed to $30.74 per ride in suburban areas, and $34.64 per ride in rural areas. PyBer drivers working in rural areas also generate nearly 3.5 times as much money per ride as those working in urban centers. 
### Summary by Months
When looking at the fares of city environments by month in 2019,

the differences between the three types of cities are not easily distinguished. They tend to mirror each other, although the earnings from rural customers tends to remain more stable.
## Recomendations
From the summary chart, it is quite obvious that while rural customers make up the smallest percentage of customers, they are willing to pay more for our service. Also, suburban usage by month tends to be the most volatile of the three. Based on this, multiple recomendations can be made:
### Incentivise drivers to work in rural areas:
- By increasing driver counts in rural areas, there may be a potential increase in rides taken by rural populations. Even accounting for a small company subsidy for rural drivers, this may still turn out to be the most profitable per-capita operation. Monitoring will have to be put in place to see if an increase of drivers leads to an increase of customers. 
### Use urban drivers to cover for the peaks of suburban usage
- There are two peaks of suburban price increases in late Feb and late April. To capitalize on these temporary price increases, urban drivers can be incentivized via subsidies to work in suburban areas temporarily, generating PyBer extra revenue to overcome the subsidies.
### Normalize driver income from Rural -> Suburban -> Urban areas
- Without affecting the PyBer budget, wage increases for urban drivers can be implemented by putting a portion of per-driver revenue of rural and suburban drivers to urban drivers. With even 10% of rural revenue being moved over to urban drivers, urban drivers will see a nearly 25% wage increase, while rural drivers will have a minimal loss of personal revenue. This may be a way to incentivize drivers in big cities to continue working for PyBer.
